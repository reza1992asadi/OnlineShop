what is routing? routing is when you want to get to different parts of your application with specific URLs, 
So far when ever you coded anything, all you did was to render everything on localhost:3000 and then you clicked
on different buttons of your app that got you to different places. But with this method you can type in a url 
that gets you to a specific page. which is cool, isn't it?
